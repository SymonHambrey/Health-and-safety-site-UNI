        <h2 class="text_main">What constitutes a 'Near Miss'?</h2>
        <p class="text_main">When an accident occurs that doesn't result in an injury, or when something happens which, if not attended to <strong>could</strong>
          result in an injury, this is a near-miss.  Near-misses are often pre-cursors to injury, and as such should be recorded, or even in some cases reported,
          so that these situations can be resolved without incident.</p>

      <div class="info">
        <p class="text_main"><strong>Please Note;</strong>&nbsp;the necessity of recording vs reporting passes no judgement on the severity of an
            accident or near-miss, it simply marks a distinction between whether an incident is reportable to the HSE/local authority for
            investigation or not.</br></br>  Please see '<a href="reportable.html">What constitutes a reportable accident?</a>' for more details</p>
