        <h2 class="text_main">Recording vs Reporting</h2>
        <p class="text_main">Every accident that takes place on University grounds, or whilst on University field trips/business
                          which takes place away from University grounds, is <strong>recordable</strong>, but not necessarily
                          <strong>reportable</strong>.</br>Any near-misses should also be recorded.</br>
                          RIDDOR requires employers and others to report deaths, certain types of injury, some occupational
                          diseases and dangerous occurrences that ‘arise out of or in connection with work’. Generally, this
                          covers incidents where the work activities, equipment or environment (including how work is carried out,
                          organised or supervised) contributed in some way to the circumstances of the accident. </p>

      <div class="info">
        <p class="text_main"><strong>Please Note;</strong>&nbsp;the necessity of recording vs reporting passes no judgement on the severity of an
            accident or near-miss, it simply marks a distinction between whether an incident is reportable to the HSE/local authority for
            investigation or not.</br></br>  Please see '<a href="reportable.html">What constitutes a reportable accident?</a>' for more details</p>
