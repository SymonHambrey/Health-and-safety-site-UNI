        <p class="text_main smallprint">The legal requirements for recording and reporting accidents, diseases and dangerous incidents at work are laid down in the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1979, the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurences Regulations (RIDDOR) 1995.</p>
        <p class="text_main smallprint">The information on this site is intended as general guidance and should not be treated as a complete and authoritative statement of the law.</p>
        <p class="text_main smallprint">You should ensure that you understand fully the regulations as they apply to you.  Find more information from the Government <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/">here</a>.</p>
        <p class="text_main smallprint"><strong>Employees:</strong><br>If the accident stops you from working, your emplyer may pay you sick pay from a private sick pay scheme.  Whether or not this is paid, Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) should be paid.  If you do not qualify for SSP from your employer, you may be able to get State Sickness Benefit.  Ask at your local Social Security office about this.</p>
        <p class="text_main smallprint">If the accident disables you, you may be entitled to Disablement Benefit.  To claim this benefit you will need form <a href="https://www.gov.uk/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefit/how-to-claim">B|100</a>.</p>
        <p class="text_main smallprint">If the accident has not affected you, you should protect your future right to benefit, because the accident may affect you later on.  Ask at your local JobCentre Plus for form B|95 <i>Accident at work: What to do about it</i>.</p>
