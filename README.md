# Health-and-safety-site-UNI

This is the prototype for the health and safety accident report system
Part of my University Systems Analysis and Design module

It is designed to allow anyone, regardless of technical skill, to use this online tool to report an accident to the health and safety officer of the institution.

There is also an administration tool to allow viewing and following up of messages and reports
